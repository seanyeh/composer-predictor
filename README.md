# Composer Predictor
#####EECS 349
#####Sean Yeh and Paul Juhn

### About
Our attempt to use machine learning to predict the composer of a musical piece.

### Usage Steps
    1. Split each raw data file into multiple examples by running:
    ```
    ./preprocess.py
    ```
    (this only needs to be run once, but no harm in running multiple times). The resulting data will be stored in `data/preprocessed/`

    2. Coming soon
